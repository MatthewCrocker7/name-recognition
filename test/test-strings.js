	paragraphs : `View Jennifer's Bio \n Maybe you have already picked up on this from her photo, but there’s a warmth in Jennifer’s eyes that just makes you feel as though you are an immediate part of her circle. If you already know her, you know exactly what we are talking about. There are so many things that make Jennifer so special to her peers. But if you ask around, the overwhelming reply is that she truly listens to every word you say and you instantly become a fixture in her mind. Building a business like she has over the past 20+ years is far from easy, but the hand-selected group of professionals that surround her at Spencer Properties carefully ensures that her vision and goals are achieved … not to mention that they have a ridiculous amount of fun together! \n Jennifer was born and raised in North Raleigh, right off of Honeycutt Road. Her roots run deep and she rarely meets a stranger – it’s also evident that her husband and four children are just as warm and friendly as she is. In this neck of the woods, there’s a Spencer family fan everywhere you turn. When Jennifer is ready for a little breather from her impressive to-do list, you can find her doing adventurous things like downhill skiing out west, traveling to some small village, or exploring our National parks. No matter what she’s doing though, you better believe that she has an adorable outfit, comfortable fantastic shoes, and a themed playlist perfectly coordinated for each and every outing. \n Jennifer has a “Go Big or Go Home” outlook on life, she’s both an early riser and a night owl, and she is a mentor by nature. So yes, you could say that Jennifer put the Spencer in Spencer Properties, but we all know that it takes more than just a name: it takes a tremendous amount of heart, an unmatched level of loyalty, and true sacrifice to be the real deal. You’ll quickly see that anyone connected with Spencer Properties is an immediate member of the Spencer family, so welcome home!! Now go make sure your room is cleaned up, grab a fuzzy blanket, get ready for family movie night. Remember to grab your matching slippers, too. It’s always all-in at the Spencer’s. \n Contact Jennifer \n 919-602-7411 \n jennifer@spencerprop.com \n View Jennifer's Video \n Jennifer Spencer, CRS, SFR, SPS \n Broker/Owner



Lisa Jackson Senior Listing Broker/BIC \n View Lisa's Bio \n You’ll easily find something you have in common with Lisa because she’s full of surprises and experiences like no other. Lisa’s roots are deep in both of the Carolina’s – born in South, raised in North. You can’t get any more Carolina than that … except that she’s not a Tarheel, but a Wake Forest Deacon. When Lisa is “off” from being one of the most successful Senior Listing Brokers in Spencer Properties’ history, she is having a fantastic time with her three grown children who are the light of her life. Being an amazing chef is just one of the many talents that Lisa has, and most certainly why her kids keep showing up for dinner. If you ever need a great home cooked meal idea, stop by and she’ll write up a shopping list faster than you can attempt to spell the word quinoa properly. Lisa is also a highly respected referee for NCAA swim meets, she absolutely loves a getaway with her friends, and she’ll give you an excellent recommendation for a perfectly-paired bottle of wine. \n We playfully call Lisa “the Bulldog” because there is absolutely nothing that will stop her from giving her clients the very best service during one of the biggest life events – selling a home. Her expertise is unmatched, and our clients absolutely rave about her market knowledge and contract execution. Lisa is the complete package, and we thank our lucky stars that she makes Spencer Properties her home. And we’ll never stop fighting for a seat next to her at lunch for a bite of her leftovers. \n Contact Lisa \n 919-810-8021 \n lisa@spencerprop.com`,
